**Start Date:** October 2025  
**Last Updated:** October 29, 2025  
**Current Status:** Week 1 ~60% Complete (4/7 days done)

Use this checklist to track your progress implementing improvements from the analysis.

## 📊 Quick Status Overview

**✅ Completed:** 
- Deployment Safety (Day 1-2) - Scripts created & tested
- Just Automation (Day 3) - 20+ commands with rebuild-pre hook
- Documentation (Day 4) - PROJECT-OVERVIEW, ARCHITECTURE, ROADMAP-VISUAL updated
- Week 2: Secrets management with automatic sync
- Week 3: Cortex provisioning (RTX 5090 + Ollama operational)

**❌ Not Started (Critical):** 
- Automated Backups (Day 6-7) - **P1 HIGHEST PRIORITY**
- Core/Optional Architecture (Day 4-5) - P2 (blocked by planning)

**🎯 Immediate Priorities:**

1. **P1 (CRITICAL): Automated Backups** - 2 hours estimated
   - Current: NO data protection for either system
   - Impact: Risk of configuration/data loss
   - Resources: Synology DS-920+ available but unused
   - See: IMPLEMENTATION-GUIDE.md Day 6-7 for implementation

2. **P2 (HIGH): Core/Optional Architecture** - 4 hours estimated
   - Current: Flat module structure (base/hardware/services/programs)
   - Impact: Scaling to 10+ systems, clearer organization
   - Blocker: Need to create MIGRATION-PLAN.md first
   - See: IMPLEMENTATION-GUIDE.md Day 3-5 for planning guide

3. **P3 (MEDIUM): Integrate Pre-flight Scripts** - 1 hour estimated
   - Current: Scripts exist but not default workflow
   - Impact: Make safe-deploy.sh the standard method
   - See: Update justfile and FLEET-MANAGEMENT.md

### Day 4: Documentation ✅ COMPLETED | Core/Optional Planning ❌ NOT STARTED

**Documentation (Day 4):**
- [x] Update PROJECT-OVERVIEW.md (October 29, 2025)
- [x] Create docs/ARCHITECTURE.md (500+ lines comprehensive guide)
- [x] Update QUICK-WINS.md with status tracking
- [x] Update ROADMAP-VISUAL.md with current progress
- [x] Consolidated secrets documentation into SECRETS.md

**Success Metric:** ✅ Documentation comprehensive and accurate

**Core/Optional Planning (Day 4 - alternative track):**
- [ ] Create `MIGRATION-PLAN.md` (from QUICK-WINS.md template)
- [ ] List all current system modules
- [ ] Mark each as [CORE] or [OPTIONAL]
- [ ] List all current home modules
- [ ] Mark each as [CORE] or [OPTIONAL]
- [ ] Review with fresh eyes - is this truly core?
- [ ] Schedule Day 5 for migration (2-3 hour block)

**Status:** Documentation completed instead. Core/Optional planning not started yet.

---

### Day 5: Core/Optional Migration ❌ NOT STARTED

- [ ] Create directories:
  ```bash
  mkdir -p modules/system/{core,optional,users}
  mkdir -p modules/home/{core,optional}
  ```
- [ ] Move system/base/* to system/core/
- [ ] Move everything else to system/optional/
- [ ] Create `modules/system/core/default.nix` with imports
- [ ] Move home/programs core files to home/core/
- [ ] Move everything else to home/optional/
- [ ] Update `systems/orion/default.nix` imports
- [ ] Update `systems/cortex/default.nix` imports
- [ ] Test rebuild Orion: `just rebuild-orion`
- [ ] Test deploy Cortex: `just deploy-cortex`
- [ ] Verify no regressions (check systemctl status)
- [ ] Commit: `git add -A && git commit -m "refactor: adopt core/optional architecture"`

**Success Metric:** ✅ Both systems rebuild successfully with new structure

**Status:** Blocked by Day 4 planning. Current structure is flat (base/hardware/services/programs).  
**Priority:** P2 (after backups). Estimated 4 hours (1hr audit + 3hrs migration).  
**Impact:** Enables scaling to 10+ systems, clearer module organization.

---

### Day 6-7: Backup Setup ❌ NOT STARTED (HIGH PRIORITY)

#### Day 6: Manual Backup Test

- [ ] SSH into Synology: `ssh admin@synology.local`
- [ ] Create borg user on Synology
- [ ] Create backup directories on Synology
- [ ] Initialize Borg repo: `borg init --encryption=repokey-blake2 borg@synology.local:/volume1/backups/orion`
- [ ] Create test backup of ~/Documents
- [ ] Verify backup: `borg list borg@synology.local:/volume1/backups/orion`
- [ ] Delete test backup if successful
- [ ] Document Borg passphrase in password manager

**Success Metric:** ✅ Manual backup to Synology works

#### Day 7: Automated Backup Module

- [ ] Create `modules/system/optional/services/backup.nix` (from IMPLEMENTATION-GUIDE.md)
- [ ] Add borg-passphrase to secrets.yaml
- [ ] Enable backup on Orion in default.nix
- [ ] Rebuild Orion: `just rebuild-orion`
- [ ] Verify service: `systemctl status borgbackup-job-synology.service`

- [ ] Check backup: `borg list borg@synology.local:/volume1/backups/orion`
- [ ] Enable backup on Cortex in default.nix
- [ ] Deploy to Cortex: `just deploy-cortex`

**Success Metric:** ✅ Automated daily backups configured on both systems

**Status:** NO AUTOMATED BACKUPS - Critical data protection gap!  
**Priority:** P1 (HIGHEST). Estimated 2 hours total.  
**Impact:** Currently no data protection for Orion or Cortex configurations.  
**Resources:** Synology DS-920+ available but unused. See IMPLEMENTATION-GUIDE.md for backup.nix module.
